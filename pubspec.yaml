# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/Logo.png
    - assets/Image.png
    - assets/LoadImage.png
    - assets/LoadImage.jpg
    - assets/heart_empty.png
    - assets/home.png
    - assets/profile.png
    - assets/search.png
    - assets/shopping_cart.png
    - assets/edit.png
    - assets/hrfruitech.png
    - assets/wishlist_empty.png
    - assets/wishlist.png
    - assets/like.png
    - restGIF.gif
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MyFlutterApp
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/MyFlutterApp.ttf
    - family: SegoeUI
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SegoeUI.ttf
    - family: Roboto-Slab
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoSlab-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/RobotoSlab-Medium.ttf

  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
